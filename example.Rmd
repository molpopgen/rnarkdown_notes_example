# Example

This is an example of how to make an "R markdown", or `Rmd` document using a 
mixture of \LaTeX, `R` and `python` code.

You can do all of this in Rstudio, but you don't have to.  I wrote this 
using [neovim](http://www.neovim.io) with the [Rmarkdown plugin](https://github.com/vim-pandoc/vim-rmarkdown).

With any `vim`alike, to generate the `pdf` file while working, the following `normal` mode commands do the trick:

```
:RMarkdown pdf
:!evince example.pdf &
```

The second command starts my `pdf` viewer and backgrounds it.  Then, whenever I `:RMarkdown pdf` after 
some edits, the `pdf` automagically updates.

There are a lot of widgets needed to get this working:

* `R` and many packages: `knitr`, `reticulate`, and a bunch of others.
* \LaTeX
* [Image Magick](https://imagemagick.org/) for the `svg` to `png` conversion.
* Probably others.

This setup allows you to write notes and only keep the `Rmd` files on `GitHub`. With the
[fugitive](https://github.com/tpope/vim-fugitive) plugin for `vim`, I never have to 
leave the editor.

```{r setup, echo=F}
# allow Python to be used
library(reticulate)

# update as appropriate for your system.
use_python("/usr/bin/python3")
```

# Examples of using msprime

A coalescent tree under the usual assumptions will look something like Figure \ref{fig.trees}.

```{python, echo=F}
import msprime
ts = msprime.simulate(10, random_seed=42)
nl = {i:f"{j.time:.2f}" for i,j in enumerate(ts.tables.nodes)}
t = next(ts.trees())
# Need x here to store some string output that the draw
# command returns, else it gets printed to our notes
x=t.draw(path="tree.svg", format="svg",node_labels=nl,height=400,width=400)
```

```{r trees,fig.align="center",out.width="5in",fig.cap="\\label{fig.trees}A genealogy for 10 alleles.  The nodes are labelled by time, with 0 being the present.  Times are in units of generations divided by population size (N)",echo=F}
# This block creates a figure that is the \figure environment
# from LaTeX

# use image magick to convert the svg to png
system("convert tree.svg tree.png")
# Display the converted image
knitr::include_graphics("tree.png")
```

The expected time to the most recent common ancestor of $n$ alleles is $2\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right)$, in units of $2N$ generations.
However, the distribution is quite variable--see Figure \ref{fig.tmrca}.

```{python, echo=F}
import numpy as np
nreps=10000
tmrca = np.zeros(nreps)
for i, ts in enumerate(msprime.simulate(10, random_seed=666, num_replicates=nreps)):
    tmrca[i] = ts.tables.nodes.time[ts.first().roots[0]]

# convert time scale from msprime to that of the eq'n we gave.
tmrca /= 2.0
```

```{r, echo=F, fig.cap="\\label{fig.tmrca}Mean tmrca for $n=10$"}
hist(py$tmrca, xlab="TMRCA", ylab="Number",main="")
```

The mean TMRCA in Figure \ref{fig.tmrca} is `r mean(py$tmrca)` and the expectation is `r 2*(1-1/10)`.
